# mvc-conventions-aspnet
This project accompanies an article that explores the conventions in ASP&#46;NET MVC (using Core 3.1, but the conventions have been the same for quite a while).

Conventions include the following:  
* File Naming and Locations
* Basic Routing
* Views and Layout

**CodeTour**:  
This repository contains a CodeTour to walk you through the various parts of the project code. CodeTour is an extension for Visual Studio Code that can be found here: [CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour).  

To run the CodeTour, expand the "CodeTour" item in the Visual Studio Code Explorer, and click the "Start Tour" button (the green arrow).

Alternately, you can read through the article mentioned below.
